The only point of this repository is to demonstrate how to manage codepage converstions using the z/OS port of git.

The .gitattributes file has the following lines which direct git on z/OS how to convert (or not) data stored in a git repository.
*.1047		working-tree-encoding=ibm-1047	git-encoding=iso8859-1
*.1140		working-tree-encoding=ibm-1140	git-encoding=iso8859-1
*.1047u		working-tree-encoding=ibm-1047	git-encoding=utf-8
*.1140u		working-tree-encoding=ibm-1140	git-encoding=utf-8
*.1047u2	working-tree-encoding=ibm-1047	git-encoding=utf-8
*.1140u2	working-tree-encoding=ibm-1140	git-encoding=utf-8
*.utf8		working-tree-encoding=utf-8	git-encoding=utf-8

The first two cause git on z/OS to interpret a file with the associated suffixes as being ISO-8859-1 (Latin alphabet No. 1; identical to 7-bit ASCII) encoded files.
It also causes git on z/OS to:
- Convert those files from ISO8859-1 to the associated EBCDIC code page (1047 or 1140).
- Tag the files on z/OS with the appropriate associated EBCDIC code page.

The next four causes git on z/OS to interpret a file with the associated suffixes as being UTF-8 encoded files.
It also causes git on z/OS to:
- Convert those files from UTF-8 to the associated EBCDIC code page (1047 or 1140).
- Tag the files on z/OS with the appropriate associated EBCDIC code page (IBM-1047 or IBM-1140).

The last one causes git on z/OS to interpret a file with the associated suffix as being a UTF-8 encoded file.
It also causes git on z/OS to:
- Not convert it; in other words, leave it encoded as UTF-8
- Tag the files on z/OS with the UTF-8 code page.

Since the README and .gitattributes files do not match any of the lines in .gitattributes they are interpreted as ISO-8859-1, not translated, and tagged ISO8859-1.

The following characters are used in the various "codes" files:

= efbbbf    (U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE, a.k.a. UTF-8 byte order mark)
| = 7c      (U+007C VERTICAL LINE)
! = 21      (U+0021 EXCLAMATION MARK)
^ = 5e      (U+005E CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT)
[ = 5b      (U+005B LEFT SQUARE BRACKET)
¢ = c2a2    (U+00A2 CENT SIGN)
¬ = c2ac    (U+00AC NOT SIGN)
€ = e282ac  (U+20AC EURO SIGN)
] = 5d      (U+005D RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET)

codes.1047 and codes.1140 contain:     |!^[]
- only contains codes that are in both the 7-bit
codes.1047u and codes.1140u contain:   |!^[¢¬]
codes.1047u2 and codes.1140u2 contain: |!^[¢¬€]
codes.utf8 contains:                   |!^[¢¬€] prefixed by UTF-8 byte order mark
